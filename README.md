# Building and Compiling  
1. From the Vaporeon directory, ```cd vaporeonpass/vaporeonpass```
2. Run ```make``` -- this will show if your program compiles  


# Testing  
1. ```sh run.sh```
2. create tests in the ```tests``` directory. These will be ```.c``` files. The script is currently configured to loop through this entire directory and run all tests, so don't worry about much else.
